# Godot-Space-Adventure
Godot Space Adventure is a small 2d platformer game made within godot. This project was my first time with Gdscript and Godot. Within this small platformer adventure you can jump from planets to planets which will change the gravity of the player.

### Controls

A  = move left<br>
D = move right<br>
space = jump<br>
left click = shoot rope bullet<br>
right click on roop = cut rope<br>



To reach the end you will need to climb up the three and push the box on the button. Once the box is on the button you can jump to another planet! Along the way you have to swim up a waterfall to reach a small island. On this island lies a box that you can shoot your grapling rope to. This allows you to drag it with you to the next section. In the final section is a small puzzle where you have to connect the ropes to make yourself a platform where u can jump from as the jump is too high to just get to. After the puzzle walk to the flag and win the game!
